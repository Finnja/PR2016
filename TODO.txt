Having multicast troubles - I think it's because the machines are currently
on the same address, and we can't have more than one machine bind to port 
8888 for the multicast on 127.0.0.1:
- DOWN - Multicast to shut down the network
- TEST to test if ring is still connected
- Fix entity IDs (should be at most 8 chars)
- Duplication
- Message application
- File transfer application
- Make it work with diff addresses
